## Usage

```

Run `gulp watch` for building and watching your asset changes.

Run `node sentinel` to start your application. 

Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to see the action.

## Generators

Available generators:

* [sentinel] (aka [sentinel:app])
* [sentinel:component](#name)

**Note: Generators are to be run from the root directory of your app.**

### App

yo sentinel
```

### Component

```

## Bower Components

All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions are released.
